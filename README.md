# Panorama_the-Bolt-house
The Bolt House is designed for sloped land, generally more affordable than flat land. Staggered rectangular volumes are adaptable to inclined terrain, and modular distribution allows for simple extensions.

The model maximizes living space and minimizes wall construction.

Enclosure is made of structural insulated panels and creates a highly thermally-efficient building with the lowest cost-per-R available. Bolt ÃÅs house construction system is defined by a platform frame construction principle using standardized building materials together with custom prefabrication. This involves the use of SIP panels to ensure a composed pre-fabricated wall unit of OSB panels and insulation that can adapt to particular requirements. Once completed, the structure is a stable and insulated, ready to receive the protective layers. Exterior and interior sheathing can be made in different materials.
